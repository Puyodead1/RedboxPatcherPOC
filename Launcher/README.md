# Launcher
This acts as a wrapper around kioskengine.exe, which loads the Harmony dll, and all patches before loading the real kioskengine

To use this, you need to rename the original kioskengine.exe to kioskengine_o.exe, and add the build result of the launcher (named kioskengine.exe already) to the bin folder of Kiosk Engine
